# StatTracker

StatTracker started as an idea for me to track my Ranked status in League of Legends since famous sites like op.gg for Garena/SEA servers were shut down due to Riot dropping support for Garena-based apps and websites. It was also used to test out how Android applications were made.

This app supposedly lets you input your own information (whether real or not), to imitate the functions of sites like op.gg and such.
